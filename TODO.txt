Require a file for every component that lists the following:
 - dependencies (other components whose images need to be built before the current one)
 - url template
 - file dependencies (files that need to be generated by the build process before the docker image building can be done)

Refactor the way dependencies are obtained by the main application: instead of querying the modules, read them from the above files.

Instead of the component_config dictionary, we could pass a more formalised class to the image builders.

Create a package of default_component_image_builder and divide it into submodules.

Find a way to make caching possible - different directories for different versions, snapshots etc.
