Require a file for every component that lists the following:
 - dependencies (other components whose images need to be built before the current one)
 - url template

Replace the wget dependency with standard library logic - it's easy (except for the status bar that we don't really need) and I'm not sure how well maintained the wget module is.

Instead of the component_config dictionary, we could pass a more formalised class to the image builders.
